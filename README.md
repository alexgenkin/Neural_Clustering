Scripts:
* runIris.m  - neural clustering on Fisher's Iris data
* runMnist.m - neural clustering and soft clustering on MNIST data set. To use, download the MNIST dataset and adjust the path at the beginning of the script. This script also requires function 'fitclinear' from Matlab's Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

The rest are functions used by the scripts.
